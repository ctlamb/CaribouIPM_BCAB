SMC_IPM_Demography_posteriors.csv is a summary of the posterior distributions from an integrated population model of southern mountain caribou demography reported in 
Lamb et al. 2024 https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eap.2965

These data are stored in the github repository https://github.com/ctlamb/CaribouIPM_BCAB/tree/main/tables/clean

There is a row for each herd and year between 1973-2023. Note there are 40 herds, but 41 in the table because there is a Quintette (winter range, good for trend through time) 
and Quintette Full (whole area, good for population size in recent times) to match different survey areas used by BC Gov biologists in the Peace region. Contact them for more 
information, but be aware of which you are using. 

Column descriptions:
                    For each parameter value there is a median value, and then a lower 90% and upper 90% credible interval denote with .lower and .upper.

                    herd= herd name
                    year= year, typically pertaining to March survey period, but does differ between herds on different seasonal schedules
                    recovery.action.yrplus1= recovery action applied in the previous year. Because actions at yr-1 affect demography of current year
                    lamba= population growth rate (Nt/Nt-1), which is total population size at current year divided by previous year
                    recruitment.per.adult= calves/adult
                    survival= annual survival, primarily April 1-March 31 but does differ by herd depending on their survey timing, see paper and code
                    totAdultsF= total adult females ages >1
                    totAdultsMF= total adult males and females ages >1
                    totCalvesF= total female calves aged ~10 months
                    totCalvesMF= total male and female calves aged ~10 months
                    totPopF= total population of females
                    totPopMF= total population of females and males
                    .width= credible interval range (0.9, or 90%)
                    .point= descriptor of how point estimate was summarized
                    quality= "low" if estimates are prior to demographic data being collected for that herd, typically low precision and primarily informed by priors. "good" if post
                      first year of data collection. We typically recommend only using "good" for most uses.
